      <h3>Sterling Silver</h3>
      <p>
        To prevent tarnishing keep your silver stored in a clean, dry airtight
        container. Minimize your jewelry's contact with harsh chemicals. Do not
        wear your jewelry in water ( swimming, bathing or showering ). Take
        jewelry off for bed, wipe clean with a soft cloth and place back in the
        airtight container
